## Directions to M117 Classroom 

Enter Essex High School at the West entrance at Door 34. (If you are looking at the front of the High School, the entrance is to the right on the side of the building directly across the parking lot from Essex Rescue. Do not use the CTE entrance!  This entrance is near the library and is easily recognized because that side of the building is comprised almost entirely of windows). Once you enter the building, the lab is on the same floor, to the left. It is room M117.
