1. Change each task name string into an object with 2 properties: name and is_complete. Set is_complete to false
2. Update the for loop to reference task.name instead of task when printing the name
3. Add a conditional that prints the word COMPLETE after the task name if the task is complete
4. Change is_complete to true for one of your tasks
