                    <h2>Servers</h2>
					<p>A server is a computer running software which is set up to accept requests from a client and give a response. There are many different types of servers.</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Email</li>
						<li class="fragment">Web</li>
						<li class="fragment">FTP</li>
						<li class="fragment">List Server (like the step up it mailing list)</li>
					</ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>Web Servers</h2>
					<p>A web server is a specific type of server that accepts requests for a URL from a client (often a web browser) and returns a response (generally in HTML).</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>User enters URL http://www.vtworksforwomen.com/about-us into browser</li>
						<li class="fragment">Browser sends a request for the URL</li>
						<li class="fragment">Server receives a request for the URL</li>
						<li class="fragment">Server sends the text contents of an .html file in response</li>
						<li class="fragment">Browser receives the response</li>
						<li class="fragment">Browser finds any CSS or javascript or images in the HTML and sends requests to the server to download them</li>
						<li class="fragment">Browser displays the HTML to the user, applying any CSS and executing any javascript</li>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>How Does a Request Get Routed<br />to the Right Server?</h2>
					<p>In order for two computers that are connected to the internet (1 client and 1 server) to send information to one another, they have to be able to identify each other.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>IP Addresses:<br />Unique Addresses for Computers</h2>
					<p>An IP address is a unique address for a specific device that is connected to the internet. This device can be a server or a router or a printer, etc.</p>

					<p class="fragment"><a href="http://whatismyip.com">whyismyip.com</a>: 71.161.93.147</p>

                <section>
                    <h2>Domain Names<br />Human Friendly Addresses for Computers</h2>
					<p>A domain name is a human friendly unique string. Examples?</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>google.com</li>
						<li class="fragment">vsac.org</li>
						<li class="fragment">php.net</li>
						<li class="fragment">bbc.co.uk</li>
					</ul>

				<section>
                    <h2>TLDs<br />Top Level Domains</h2>
					<p>The end of a domain name (the part following the final period) is called the Top Level Domain (TLD).</p>
					<p>Some TLDs are owned by countries (.co.uk), some of governmental (.gov) or education (.edu) and some are novelty (.guru, .photography).</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>.com (commercial)</li>
						<li class="fragment">.net (network)</li>
						<li class="fragment">.org (organization)</li>
						<li class="fragment">.biz (business)</li>
						<li class="fragment">.uk (united kingdom)</li>
						<li class="fragment">.photography</li>
					</ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>DNS: The Domain Name System</h2>
					<p>The Domain Name System, or DNS, is the system responsible for translating human readable domain names like google.com into unique IP addresses for devices on the internet.</p>
					<p>This is the reason you can type google.com into your browser instead of needing to know the IP of the server where google.com is hosted, 216.58.219.206.</p>

                    <h2>Buying a Doman<br />Domain Registrars</h2>
					<p>The first step in getting your website setup so someone can visit a domain like <strong>janeswidgets.com</strong> is registering the domain. This is done through an ICANN-accredited <strong>registrar</strong>. ICANN is the  <strong>Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers</strong>, a non-profit company responsible for maintaining the databases that identify the location of all domain names in the world.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Registrars</h2>
					<p>There are over a thousand registrars. Registering a domain is a yearly fee. Price varies based on the <strong>TLD</strong> (Top Level Domain) but should be around $10/year for a .com.</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li><a href="http://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a></li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://godaddy.com">godaddy.com</a></li>

                    <h2>Web Hosting</h2>
                    <p>Web hosting is renting a web server from a company that you can place all of the files for your website on. There are different types of web hosting.</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li>Shared: Renting space on a server that also hosts other websites. Good for personal and small business websites. $4-$10/month.</li>
						<li class="fragment">Dedicated: Renting space on a server that hosts only your website. Required for security sensitive websites or sites with high traffic. $100+/month</li>
					</ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>Web Hosting Companies</h2>
                    <p>There are thousands of web hosting companies. Many comanies offer both web hosting and domain registration services. It is often less complicated to configure your website if you buy the domain from the same company where you buy the hosting.</p>
					<ul class="fragment">
						<li><a href="http://namecheap.com">namecheap.com</a></li>
						<li class="fragment"><a href="http://godaddy.com">godaddy.com</a></li>

					<h2>Connecting a Domain to a Hosting Account</h2>
					<p>When you purchase a domain name from a registrar, you are generally also purchasing DNS hosting. This means that the registrar will host the information for the Domain Name System that helps resolve your domain name to the IP address of the server where it is hosted. By default, most registrars will set the DNS servers for a new domain to point to their DNS servers. This is fine if you purchase your domain and your web hosting from the same company. If you purchased your hosting from another company, they will tell you what their DNS servers are and you will need to update your domain at your registrar to point at those DNS servers.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Setting DNS Servers for Your Domain</h2>
					<p>If you purchased hosting from a different company than you purchased the domain from, you will need to log in to the registrar and set the DNS servers for your domain. The hosting company will generally email you a list of the DNS servers which will look something like.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>dns1.namecheap.com</li>
						<li>dns2.namecheap.com</li>
						<li>dns3.namecheap.com</li>
					</ul>
					<p>Every registrar has a different web-based interface for changing DNS servers, so you may need to search their site for "Change DNS Servers" to find instructions.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>DNS Propagation</h2>
					<p>The master DNS database which holds all of the information on which IP hosts each domain name is maintained by ICANN and it can sometimes take 24-48 hours for changes to your DNS servers to propagate. This is especially true if you have previously visited the domain name, in which case your Internet Service Provider may have saved a local copy of the information of what IP to find the domain at. For this reason when buying a new domain its a good idea NOT to visit the domain your browser until you have configured the DNS servers.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Using a Proxy to View DNS Changes</h2>
					<p>If you have already visited a domain and want to change the DNS and see if your changes have taken effect, you can use a proxy service. A proxy allows you to enter a URL and it will load the page for you through another location. This can get around issues where your ISP has cached the IP address of the domain because the proxy will not use your ISP since it is in another physical location.</p>

					<h2>Uploading Your Website to a Web Server<br />using File Transfer Protocol (FTP)</h2>
					<p>FTP is a standard method for transfering files from one computer to another over the internet. FTP is commonly used to transfer website files from your computer to the web server you are renting to publish your website.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>FTP Accounts</h2>
					<p>An FTP Account or FTP Credentials is the term of the login information to an FTP server. FTP credentials always include the following 3 pieces of information.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Username</li>
						<li>Password</li>
						<li>Server Address: Address of the server (e.g. ftp.mydomain.com)</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>FTP Client Software</h2>
					<p>An FTP Client is a piece of software that allows you to connect to an FTP server using your credentials (username/password). There are many pieces of free FTP client software.</p>
					<ul>
						<li><a href="https://cyberduck.io">Cyberduck</a></li>
						<li><a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a></li>
						<li><a href="http://fireftp.net/">FireFTP</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Uploading Files via FTP<br />The Web Root</h2>
					<p>The <strong>Web Root</strong> is the name of a folder on your web hosting server where files should be stored in order for them to be web accessible. Any files in this folder will be available via http://www.mydomain.com/filename.html. When you connect to your hosting account using FTP, you will see a list of files and folders. One of these folders is generally the webroot. The webroot folder is usually named one of the following things:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>public_html</li>
						<li>www</li>
						<li>www.mydomain.com</li>
					</ul>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>The Home Page: index.html</h2>
					<p>Most popular pieces of web server software will automatically shows the file named index.html when the user requests a folder. When the user visit http://www.mydomain.com most web servers will look for a file named index.html in the web root folder.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Running a Web Server Locally</h2>
					<p>It is often convenient to run a web server locally on your computer so you can test your website. This is not required if your website is composed of simple html files, but if you use a server side language like PHP you will need a web server to interpret your PHP files into HTML. Depending on your operating system there are a number of free options for installing the popular web server Apache on your local computer.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h2>Running the Apache Web Server<br />On Your Computer</h2>
					<ul>
						<li>Windows: <a href="https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html">XAMPP</a></li>
						<li>Mac OS X: <a href="http://www.mamp.info/en/">MAMP</a></li>
						<li>Linux: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_(software_bundle)">LAMP</a></li>
					</ul>
				</section>
